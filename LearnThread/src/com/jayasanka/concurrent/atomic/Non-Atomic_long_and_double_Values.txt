if we read a variable without proper synchronization, we may see a stale value. 
For long and double values, quite surprisingly, it's even possible to see completely random values in addition to stale ones.

According to JLS-17, JVM may treat 64-bit operations as two separate 32-bit operations. 
Therefore, when reading a long or double value, it's possible to read an updated 32-bit along with a stale 32-bit. 

Consequently, we may observe random-looking long or double values in concurrent contexts.
On the other hand, writes and reads of volatile long and double values are always atomic.
